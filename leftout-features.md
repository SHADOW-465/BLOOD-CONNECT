# BloodConnect Pro - Left Out & Incomplete Features

This document outlines the features from the project prompt that are either incomplete or entirely missing from the current "Phase 1" implementation of BloodConnect Pro.

## Summary of Current State

The existing application is a functional prototype with a solid foundation. It includes:
- User authentication (Email/Password, Google OAuth).
- A 3-step donor onboarding flow (Eligibility, Profile, Availability).
- A basic dashboard displaying emergency requests, an impact summary, and a next donation tracker.

However, most of the advanced, AI-powered, integrated, and community-focused features are not yet implemented. The following is a detailed breakdown of the gaps.

---

### 1. Emergency Request System (Partially Implemented)

The core SOS button and request creation form exist, but the "smart" and "mass-notification" capabilities are missing.

- **Incomplete Features:**
    - **Smart Matching Algorithm:** The current system only displays requests. It does not actively match donors based on blood type compatibility, proximity, availability, or last donation date.
    - **Real-time Status Updates:** The app shows requests but does not track donor responses or provide live updates on their status (e.g., "Accepted," "On the way").
- **Missing Features:**
    - **Medical Compatibility Scores:** No system for scoring donors based on detailed medical compatibility.
    - **Mass Notification System:** No backend implementation for sending push notifications, SMS, email, or WhatsApp alerts to matched donors.
    - **Emergency Escalation:** No logic to automatically escalate a request to a wider radius if no donors are found within a set time (e.g., 15 minutes).

### 2. Advanced Donor Management (Partially Implemented)

A basic onboarding flow and profile exist, but they lack dynamic and advanced features.

- **Incomplete Features:**
    - **Dynamic Profiles:** Profiles are static after onboarding. They do not automatically update eligibility based on donation history.
    - **Availability Status:** The availability toggle is part of the initial onboarding but is not a quick, easily accessible feature on the main dashboard for temporary status changes.
- **Missing Features:**
    - **Health Monitoring:** No integration with fitness apps (e.g., Google Fit, Apple Health) for tracking weight or other health metrics.
    - **Donation Calendar:** No personal calendar for donors to see their donation schedule or receive optimal timing suggestions.
    - **Medical History Vault:** No secure vault for users to store health records or test results.

### 3. Intelligent Scheduling System (Mostly Missing)

While a "Schedule" button exists, the entire intelligent backend system is not implemented.

- **Missing Features:**
    - **AI-Powered Slot Optimization:** No machine learning model to suggest the best appointment times.
    - **Multi-Channel Reminders:** No system for sending push, SMS, email, or voice call reminders for appointments.
    - **Weather Integration:** No feature to check for extreme weather and suggest rescheduling.
    - **Queue Management:** No real-time display of wait times or queue position for donation centers.
    - **Flexible Rescheduling:** No one-tap reschedule functionality with alternative slot suggestions.

### 4. Blood Journey & Gamification (Mostly Missing)

The dashboard has a basic "Impact Summary," but all gamification and detailed tracking features are missing.

- **Incomplete Features:**
    - **Impact Dashboard:** The current summary is basic. The donation streak counter is noted as "to be fully implemented."
- **Missing Features:**
    - **Complete Journey Tracking:** No system to track a donation from the donor to the (anonymized) recipient.
    - **Achievement System:** No badges, milestones, or rewards for donation consistency or special donations.
    - **Leaderboards:** No local, national, or global donor rankings.
    - **Social Sharing:** No functionality to share achievements on social media.
    - **Donor Stories:** No section to feature regular donors and their impact.

### 5. Inventory & Hospital Integration (Completely Missing)

There is currently no integration with hospitals or any inventory management features.

- **Missing Features:**
    - Real-Time Stock Levels
    - Predictive Analytics for Demand Forecasting
    - Expiry Alerts for Blood Bags
    - Critical Level Warnings

    - QR Code System for Check-ins
    - Telemedicine Integration for Pre-donation Consultations

### 9. Multi-Platform Accessibility (Partially Missing)

The app is a web app, which is a starting point for a PWA, but lacks other accessibility channels.

- **Incomplete Features:**
    - **Progressive Web App (PWA):** The app is built on Next.js but is likely not fully configured as a PWA with offline capabilities and service workers.
- **Missing Features:**

### 10. Security & Privacy (Partially Missing)

The app uses Supabase for core security but lacks the specified advanced features.

- **Missing Features:**
    - **Immutable Audit Logs:** No blockchain alternative or immutable logging system is in place.
